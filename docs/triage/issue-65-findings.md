# Issue #65 — "Webcam doesn't work on Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 960QHA" (@seshf)

**Status:** first fix landed (`646d668`); **the issue is not closed** — the
relay now starts but the reporter says the camera still does not appear in the
browser. Round 2 (below) adds the measurement needed to find out why.

Round 1 reply **posted** 2026-07-21 with maintainer sign-off —
[comment-5039649723](https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book-linux-fixes/issues/65#issuecomment-5039649723).

Hardware: Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 **960QHA**, IPU7 + **OV02E10**, Kubuntu 26.04,
kernel 7.1.1-070101-generic, Wayland.

## What the thread actually established

The reporter's own commands rule out every layer we'd normally suspect:

| Evidence | Conclusion |
| --- | --- |
| `bind ov02e10 3-0010`, `All sensor registration completed` | kernel + IPU7 fine |
| `cam -l` → `1: Internal front camera (\_SB_.LNK0)` | libcamera enumerates fine |
| `[BAYER-FIX] transform=3 … override=auto` | our patched libcamera **is** loaded |
| `gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink` → **working picture**, 30 fps | the whole camera stack works |
| `gst-inspect-1.0 libcamerasrc` → found, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0/libgstlibcamera.so` | the plugin is installed |
| `lsmod` → `v4l2loopback 61440 0` | loopback module loaded |
| Firefox/Brave/Chromium → `NotFoundError` | **nothing is feeding the loopback** |

And the failure itself:

```
$ camera-relay start
ERROR: GStreamer 'libcamerasrc' element not found. Install it:
  ...
  Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libcamera

$ sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libcamera
gstreamer1.0-libcamera ist schon die neueste Version (0.7.0-1ubuntu2).
```

So the relay refused to start, claiming a package was missing that was already
installed — and the element it claimed was missing demonstrably worked.

The `intel-ipu7-psys … -22` and `Unable to get rectangle` messages in the
original report are noise; they appear on working systems (already answered in
the thread).

## Root cause

`gst-inspect-1.0` and `gst-launch-1.0` ship in **`gstreamer1.0-tools`** on
Debian/Ubuntu (`gstreamer1` on Fedora, `gstreamer` on Arch). Verified locally:

```
$ dpkg -S $(command -v gst-inspect-1.0)   → gstreamer1.0-tools
$ dpkg -S $(command -v gst-launch-1.0)    → gstreamer1.0-tools
$ apt-cache depends gstreamer1.0-libcamera   → no dependency on gstreamer1.0-tools
```

**No installer in this repo ever installs that package**, and nothing else in
the dependency graph pulls it in. Yet `gst-launch-1.0` *is* the relay pipeline
(`camera-relay/camera-relay:456`), and `gst-inspect-1.0` is how the relay and
both installers probe for `libcamerasrc`.

When the binary is absent, `gst-inspect-1.0 libcamerasrc &>/dev/null` exits
**127**, which is indistinguishable from "element not found" to a bare `if !`.
The recovery ladder in `setup_environment()` then retries three times — clear
the registry cache, drop the `/usr/local` overrides — and all three fail
identically, because none of them make the missing binary appear. The relay dies
pointing at the wrong package, which is the dead end the reporter spent the
thread in.

### Why the reporter's paste pins this down

Their output is *only* the `ERROR:` block — no `[camera-relay] Using GStreamer
plugin: …` and no `WARNING: Source-built libcamerasrc … failed to load`. Those
two lines are emitted whenever `detect_gst_plugin_path` / `detect_libcamera_lib_path`
find anything under `/usr/local`. Their absence proves there were **no
`/usr/local` overrides in play**, so all three ladder attempts ran in a pristine
environment — the same environment in which their own `gst-inspect-1.0
libcamerasrc` succeeded 90 minutes later. A missing binary is the only
explanation that fails in that environment and is unaffected by all three
recovery steps.

Reproduced locally by running the pre-fix `camera-relay` with an empty `PATH`;
it emits the reporter's error text verbatim.

**Residual uncertainty:** the reporter's later commands show `gst-inspect-1.0`
working, so they installed `gstreamer1.0-tools` at some point between 20:13 and
21:56 UTC without pasting it (their pasted `apt install gstreamer1.0-libcamera`
installed nothing). The reply asks them to confirm with
`dpkg -l gstreamer1.0-tools`. If it turns out to have been installed all along,
the diagnostics added here will print GStreamer's real complaint on the next
attempt, which is the information the current message throws away.

## Fix

**`camera-relay/camera-relay`**

- `require_gst_tools()` — checks `gst-inspect-1.0` **and** `gst-launch-1.0` up
  front and names `gstreamer1.0-tools` / `gstreamer1` / `gstreamer`. Called
  from `setup_environment()` and `cmd_enable_persistent()` (the latter also
  probes with `gst-inspect-1.0`; with the tools missing it silently baked
  system-only paths into a unit for a relay that could not run).
- `find_libcamera_gst_plugin()` — when `libcamerasrc` genuinely won't load but
  `libgstlibcamera.so` is on disk, say *that* and print `gst-inspect-1.0`'s real
  stderr plus the three commands worth running, instead of telling the user to
  install a package they already have.
- `cmd_status()` — the `Loopback:` line read only the runtime cache, so it
  printed `(not loaded)` whenever the relay had never started, even with the
  module loaded and a device present. Now falls back to
  `detect_loopback_device`, mirroring the `Camera:` line. This actively misled
  the reporter, whose `lsmod` contradicted it.

**`webcam-fix-book5/install.sh`, `webcam-fix-libcamera/install.sh`**

- Install the GStreamer CLI tools before any `gst-inspect-1.0` probe. In
  `webcam-fix-libcamera` this is `ensure_gst_tools()`, called before the
  `verify_libcamerasrc` gate — that gate is a hard `exit 1`, so a host without
  the tools previously aborted the whole install with a false diagnosis.
- Corrected the Ubuntu/Debian remedy package for a genuinely missing
  `libcamerasrc`: `gstreamer1.0-libcamera` (was `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`,
  which does not contain the element on Ubuntu), keeping the old package as a
  fallback.

NixOS needs no change — `nixos/webcam-fix-book5.nix:130` already wraps the relay
with `pkgs.gst_all_1.gstreamer`, which provides both binaries.

## Verification

`camera-relay/tests/test-gst-tools-check.sh` (new, 7 assertions, no camera
hardware required, no system state touched — it redirects `XDG_CACHE_HOME` so the
recovery ladder cannot clear the real GStreamer registry):

1. with the tools unreachable, `start` fails naming `gstreamer1.0-tools` and
   **not** `gstreamer1.0-libcamera`;
2. `find_libcamera_gst_plugin` locates an installed plugin;
3. with a stub `gst-inspect-1.0` that always fails, the error says the plugin
   *is* installed and echoes GStreamer's own stderr;
4. `status` reports the live loopback device instead of `(not loaded)`.

Results — **7/7 pass** on the fixed code. Against `HEAD:camera-relay/camera-relay`
the suite fails, and the old run reproduces the reporter's error text verbatim
(including the absence of the `WARNING: Source-built libcamerasrc …` line when no
`/usr/local` build is present). All modified scripts pass `bash -n`.

Running the new diagnostic branch caught a `set -euo pipefail` bug in the fix
itself: `inspect_err=$(gst-inspect-1.0 … | tail -5)` aborted the script before it
could print, since `gst-inspect-1.0` exits non-zero there by definition. Fixed
with `|| true`; the branch was only proven by executing it, not by reading it.

**Not verified:** nothing here was run on a 960QHA. There is no Book5 hardware
in this environment, so "the reporter's camera now works in Firefox" is a
hypothesis, not a result. What is verified is that the relay no longer
misdiagnoses a missing `gstreamer1.0-tools`, and that new installs get the
package.

# Round 2 — the relay starts, the browser still sees nothing

## What changed in the thread

The reporter got past the original error (comment at 22:13 UTC):

```
$ camera-relay status
  State:      STOPPED
  Persistent: ENABLED (on-demand, auto-starts on login)
  Camera:     \_SB_.LNK0
  Loopback:   /dev/video0

$ camera-relay start
[camera-relay] Relay started (PID 190348)
[camera-relay] Camera available as 'Camera Relay' in apps
```

> "Now i can start and stop the camera. But is not working in the Browser"

Two later comments add:

- `cam -c1 -C10` captures 10 frames at 40 fps, `bytesused: 8355840`
  (= 1920×1088×4, so their default libcamera stream is **1920x1088**);
- `pkg-config --modversion libcamera` → 0.7.0, and the bayer-fix backup at
  `/var/lib/libcamera-bayer-fix-backup/` holds only an empty `usr/` tree;
- `groups` → they **are** in `video`.

They still have not answered `dpkg -l gstreamer1.0-tools`, so round 1's
diagnosis remains unconfirmed. Note `Persistent: ENABLED` while `State: STOPPED`
— the systemd on-demand unit was enabled but not running, which round 1's
missing-`gstreamer1.0-tools` theory explains (the unit dies in
`setup_environment` and `Restart=on-failure` gives up).

## Hypotheses tested and rejected

Both were checked on the maintainer's Book4 (OV02C10, libcamera 0.7.2) rather
than argued about:

1. **Hardcoded `width=1920,height=1080` in the on-demand pipeline breaks a
   1088-tall sensor.** `camera-relay:631` and the monitor's `argv` both pin
   1920x1080, and the reporter's stream is 1920x1088, so a negotiation failure
   looked likely. **Rejected:** `libcamerasrc ! videoconvert !
   video/x-raw,format=YUY2,width=1280,height=720` negotiates fine — libcamera
   reconfigures the stream to whatever size is requested, confirmed by
   `gst-launch-1.0 -v` reporting `width=(int)1280, height=(int)720`. Asking a
   1088-native sensor for 1080 therefore works. The hardcoding is still
   fragile, but it is **not** this bug, so it was left alone.
2. **v4l2loopback advertises no formats until a writer sets one, so browsers
   skip it.** **Rejected:** with no writer at all, `v4l2-ctl --list-formats` on
   the loopback returns a full list (BGR4, RGB4, AR24, …).

## Root cause of round 2: we cannot see what is happening

The thread has now spent six round trips on "the relay starts but the browser
sees nothing" because **no command in this repo reports whether frames are
actually reaching the loopback**. `gst-launch-1.0 ... autovideosink` showing a
picture proves the camera works and says nothing about the device browsers read;
`lsmod` proves the module is loaded and says nothing about frames.

Worse, when the relay pipeline *does* fail, `cmd_start` printed an empty report.
Two stacked bugs:

1. it tailed `camera-relay.log` — the **on-demand daemon's** log — while
   `start_pipeline` writes `camera-relay-gst.log`;
2. even with the path corrected, `tail -20 "$gst_log" 2>/dev/null >&2` applies
   redirections left to right: fd 2 goes to `/dev/null`, then `>&2` duplicates
   *that* onto fd 1, so tail's output was discarded.

So the user saw:

```
ERROR: Relay failed to start. GStreamer output:
───────────────────────────────────────────────
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Both bugs had to be fixed for the block to print anything; fixing only the path
(the obvious one) still yields an empty banner. Caught by writing the test
first, not by reading the code.

## Fix

**`camera-relay/camera-relay`**

- `cmd_doctor()` — new `camera-relay doctor` command. One paste-able report:
  system/kernel/session, `video` group membership, tool presence, libcamera
  version + camera name + plugin path + whether `libcamerasrc` loads, module
  and device state with the negotiated format, relay/service/monitor-binary
  state, browser packaging (snap and flatpak confinement), and recent GStreamer
  and journal logs.
  The decisive section is **Frames on the loopback**: it streams 60 frames,
  keeps the last 256 KB (skipping the monitor's black start-up placeholders)
  and classifies the result as `NO FRAMES` / `BLANK FRAMES` / `REAL PICTURE`
  by counting distinct byte values. That single line separates "our relay is
  broken" from "your browser cannot see a working device".
- `cmd_start()` — corrected the log path and the redirection order so a failed
  pipeline actually shows GStreamer's error.

Two bugs in `cmd_doctor` were themselves caught by running it, not reading it:
`lsmod | grep -q v4l2loopback` reported the module as absent (grep exits on the
first match, SIGPIPEs `lsmod`, and `set -o pipefail` fails the whole test — it
now reads `/proc/modules` directly), and `systemctl is-active ... || echo
inactive` printed `inactive` twice, since `is-active` prints its answer *and*
exits non-zero.

**Not changed:** the hardcoded 1920x1080 (see rejected hypothesis 1) and the
same `find | grep -q .` pipefail pattern in `detect_ipa_path()`, which is
pre-existing and unrelated to this issue.

## Verification

`camera-relay/tests/test-gst-tools-check.sh` grew from 7 to 11 assertions.
The new ones:

5. a pipeline failure (forced by seeding the camera-name cache with a
   non-existent camera) reports the failure **and** includes GStreamer's own
   output — asserted by matching on the empty-banner shape, so it fails if
   either of the two stacked bugs is present;
6. `doctor` classifies a synthetic all-black stream (`videotestsrc
   pattern=black ! v4l2sink`) as `BLANK FRAMES` rather than success, and runs
   to completion with exit 0.

Results — **11/11 pass** on the fixed code; against `HEAD:camera-relay/camera-relay`
the three new assertions fail. `doctor` was additionally run by hand in all
three frame states on the maintainer's Book4: relay stopped → `NO FRAMES`,
synthetic black stream → `BLANK FRAMES`, relay running → `REAL PICTURE — 262144
bytes captured, 122 distinct byte values`.

**Not verified:** still nothing on a 960QHA. Round 2 does not claim to fix the
reporter's camera — it makes the next report diagnostic instead of anecdotal.

## Round 2 reply posted to #65 (2026-07-21)

[comment-5040240218](https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book-linux-fixes/issues/65#issuecomment-5040240218).
Confirms the camera and permissions are fine and the backup directory is a
red herring, then asks for the one measurement nobody has taken: a live frame
off `/dev/video0` with its distinct-byte-value count, plus
`camera-relay status` after start, the GStreamer log, `systemctl --user status`,
and `snap list` (snap-confined browsers would explain all three failing at
once). `doctor` itself is not on `main` yet, so the reply spells out the raw
`v4l2-ctl` equivalent instead of pointing at the new command.

# Round 3 — `STREAMING` with a loopback refcount of 0

Reporter comment 2026-07-21 23:51 (written before they saw the round 2
questions), plus their guess that stale device nodes are to blame:

> "The many /dev/video are from older test installs. I don't known how i can
> remove the /dev/video that don't exists physical. Maybe this is the problem
> why that don't work in the Browser and VCL."

```
$ camera-relay status
  State:      STREAMING (PID 207442)
  Loopback:   /dev/video0

$ ls -l /dev/video*      → video0 … video32   (33 nodes)
$ lsmod | grep v4l2loopback
v4l2loopback           61440  0
```

## Their theory is wrong, and the paste contains the real anomaly

**The 33 nodes are normal.** Checked against the maintainer's working Book4:
it has **49** — `video0: Camera Relay` plus `video1…video48: Intel IPU6 ISYS
Capture 0…47`. IPU6/IPU7 ISYS registers one node per virtual stream; they are
not leftovers, cannot be removed, and are not the problem. Their layout matches
a healthy machine, `video0` included: v4l2loopback loads before the IPU driver
and takes the first minor.

**The anomaly is `v4l2loopback 61440 0` while `status` says STREAMING.** The
third column is the module reference count. Measured on Book4:

| Relay state | refcount | holder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| stopped | 0 | — |
| streaming | 1 | `gst-launch-1.0` (`fuser -v /dev/video0`) |

So on a working system a streaming relay holds the device and the count is 1.
The reporter's count is **0 while the relay claims to be streaming**: no process
has the loopback open, therefore nothing has written a frame to it, therefore
browsers correctly report no camera. Whatever PID 207442 is, its pipeline is not
attached to `/dev/video0`.

This is possible because `is_running()` only does `kill -0` on the PID from
`$PID_FILE`, and `cmd_status` prints `STREAMING` from `$STATE_CACHE`. Neither
looks at the device. A pipeline that exits, or never opens the sink, leaves both
saying everything is fine.

## Fix

`cmd_doctor()` now prints the module reference count and, when it is 0, says
plainly that nothing has the device open and that a `STREAMING` line below it is
therefore false. One `awk` on `/proc/modules`; no new dependency. Verified in
both states on Book4 (`refcount 0` + warning when stopped, `refcount 1` and no
warning when streaming). Suite still 11/11.

Still open: *why* the pipeline detaches on the 960QHA. `doctor`'s frame check
plus the GStreamer log it prints should answer that in one paste — the reporter
has not run it yet.
